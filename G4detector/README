HOW TO RUN

    - Execute Ex in the 'interactive mode':
      % ./Ex
      set the energy
        Idle> /Ex/energy 20 TeV
	  choose the type of the particle
        Idle> /Ex/type 1
	  run the simulation
        Idle> /run/beamOn 1
		
        Idle> ...
        Idle> exit
      To enable visualization, the code in src/TrackingAction.cc must be modified
	  fpTrackingManager->SetStoreTrajectory(true)
      The trajectory information will be stored in RAM, be sure to assign enough memory to avoid crush 

    - Execute in the 'batch' mode from macro files 
	  % ./Ex [-m macro ] [-e eventid] [-f filename]
      example macro file: tau20.mac, had20.mac
	  The seed of the random engine is the same as the event ID. 
	  The default event ID is zero. 
	  The event ID is increased by one after each event.
	  filename: name of the output file.
